<p>There are a few considerations when dealing with chaotic trends that this article highlights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>complex etiologies</strong>: volatile patterns typically exhibit complex causes. Disentangling a phenomenon’s complicated origins enables better prediction of its future patterns.</li>
  <li>
<strong>measurement uncertainty</strong>: data and trends are often treated as certain fact. In reality most data is collected and curated by humans and human systems. This creates a real possibility for measurement errors as well as discrepancies arising from measurement methodologies.</li>
  <li>
<strong>external covariates</strong>: the fundamental process behind scientific reasoning is crucial for taming seemingly unpredictable trends: associating some variables to the outcome of others. With robust patterns of association between variables we can use information on accessible variables to predict outcomes in (potentially directly inaccessible) variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>From July 2010 to July 2020, the total disabled population increased from about 26 million to 29 million. That is an increase of about 11.5% over 10 years, or an annual increase of about 1.1%. From July 2020 to July 2023, the disabled population increased from 29 million to about 34 million. That translates to an increase of 17.2% over 3 years, or an annual growth of 5.4%.</p>
