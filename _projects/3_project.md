This overview covers a research project I completed for a major semiconductor manufacturer. The company has since merged with another major manufacturer. At the time, the firm had multibillion dollar semiconductor sales and specialized in integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are silicon wafers with embedded transistors and other electronic components. This is in contrast to discrete circuits where separate electronic components are connected together. While discrete circuits allow for more customization, integrated circuits enjoy several advantages: mass-production, cost-efficacy, lower power consumption. 

# Business Context and Moore's Law

Gordon Moore was an engineer and entrepeneur who founded his own semiconductor company.  In 1975 he observed that the transistor count on integrated circuits was doubling roughly every two years. He projected this trend to continue for the next decade, and indeed it has persisted until very recently; so this phenomenon has been named *Moore's law*. This process of doubling the transistor count on integrated circuits has largely been driven by miniaturization of components. As of recently, this process is approaching its limits, and there has been increasing emphasis on 3D stacking of transistors to continue processing power gains.

Some leading technologists have claimed Moore's law is dead; others argue it is still a force. If you are curious to learn more about Moore's law and associated manufacturing trends in the semiconductor industry, check out the links below:

The motto of the real estate industry is "location, location, location," emphasizing how important location is to present and future property values. In the semiconductor industry the saying is, "faster, smaller, cheaper." This is driven by Moore's law and by the ever-increasing expectations of consumers. The end result is a highly competitive market with high barriers to entry and steep operating costs. The miniaturization of electronic components and exponentially increasing transistor counts creates a need for precision and purity in the manufacturing environment. 

As one <a href="https://www.chinawaterrisk.org/resources/analysis-reviews/8-things-you-should-know-about-water-and-semiconductors/">site</a> points out, semiconductor fabrication requires a tremendous amount of water. Fabrication of a 30cm wafer requires up to 2200 gallons of water; a large fabrication facility may easily consume 4.8 million gallons per day. This is average annual water consumption of a city of 60000! And not just any water. Minute contaminants in the water can create impurities and defects in integrated circuits. Therefore water is passed through reverse osmosis several times to produce "ultra pure water." Ultra pure water is considered an industrial solvent, and it is unsafe to drink. It is so pure, its consumption leeches vital minerals from the body and will eventually kill the consumer. It takes 1400-1600 gallons of municipal water to create 1000 gallons of ultra pure water.

In addition to water, other fabrication makes intensive use of other resources. A large manufacturing facility can use 30-50 megawatts during peak production; this is enough to power a small city. Fabrication facilities need to have pressurized chambers, fans, and well-designed air flow patterns to reduce impurities introduced via the air. As part of my work on this project, I was given a tour of a fabrication facility. The tour required wearing the appropriate protective gear to prevent contamination of the manufacturing process. Additionally, the lights in the fabrication rooms were yellow; apparently this spectrum of light is least likely to interact with wafers and components. The intensity of semiconductor manufacturer and the demands of the highly competitive semiconductor market mean production costs must be optimized for a firm to be viable.

As a result of these demands and constraints, rigorous production processes are put in place. Environmental variables are tightly controlled to ensure a robust manufacturing process minimizing errors. Nonetheless, product defects do occur. They must be cataloged and studied to improve the manufacturing process. This endeavor can be costly and time-consuming. Without more sophisticated approaches, the process of categorizing product defects is done through inspection by engineers. Hence a challenge for the manufacturer is how to efficiently classify defective products into defect patterns. 

At best an engineer tends to classify one image per minute. There may be thousands of defective products on a product line, and so the defect classification process can take up to two weeks of an engineerâ€™s time for a single product line. An automated approach, has the potential to mitigate this. Ideally, if this can be done with minimal time investment by engineers, it frees up labor for finding solutions to product issues. This frees an engineer to focus on finding sources of product defects and investigating manufacturing process improvements.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
