Welcome to my personal page! Pardon any mess, this site was started mid 2023 and construction is still ongoing. Check out my embedded [blog](https://nghaffari.github.io/blog/), my [project](https://nghaffari.github.io/projects/) write ups, and my [teaching](https://nghaffari.github.io/teaching/) materials. If you would like to find out more about my academic and professional background, check out my [cv](https://nghaffari.github.io/cv/) page.
