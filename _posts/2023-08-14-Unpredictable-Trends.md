## Chaotic Signals

There are a few considerations when dealing with chaotic trends that this article highlights:

1. **complex etiologies**: volatile patterns typically exhibit complex causes. Disentangling a phenomenon's complicated origins enables better prediction of its future patterns. 
2. **measurement uncertainty**: data and trends are often treated as certain fact. In reality most data is collected and curated by humans and human systems. This creates a real possibility for measurement errors as well as discrepancies arising from measurement methodologies.
3. **external covariates**: the fundamental process behind scientific reasoning is crucial for taming seemingly unpredictable trends: associating some variables to the outcome of others. With robust patterns of association between variables we can use information on accessible variables to predict outcomes in (potentially directly inaccessible) variables.

## The World's Gone Mad

From July 2010 to July 2020, the total disabled population increased from about 26 million to 29 million. That is an increase of about 11.5% over 10 years, or an annual increase of about 1.1%. From July 2020 to July 2023, the disabled population increased from 29 million to about 34 million. That translates to an increase of 17.2% over 3 years, or an annual growth of 5.4%.
