## Stop Slouching!

"Sit up straight and stop slouching!" Words one might hear from a doting grandparent. Growing up, older generations did not have cellphones, tablets, gaming devices, laptops, and desktops that younger generations must contend with. Average life back in the day was also far more physical. That and people interacted face-to-face far more than our overconnected, constantly-plugged-in, post-pandemic generations. As a consequence, there was a clear, intuitive understanding among general people of the good posture. Even as recently as my childhood, when I was a bit of bookworm and developed a bit (actually quite a bit) of bad posture, I recall how most people around me had decent, strong posture. Sadly, among today's up-and-coming generations mirred in hours of screen time, my old posture would not seem abnormal.

## Health Effects of Postural Imbalance

Postural imbalances have been linked to a host of health ailments and even accelerated aging.

One research group at the University of Leeds found a connection between neck posture and changes in cardiorespiration. The team was motivated by previous findings that chiropractic manipulations, particularly of the C1 vertebrae, can induce changes in blood pressure. Their research revealed that the muscles of the neck, especially the suboccipital muscle group, send afferent signals to the intermedius of the medulla, a brain stem component. In turn this part of the brainstem sends signals to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The NTS is directly involved in altering cardiorespiratory variables such as blood pressure and breathing rate. In short, the evidence suggests that crooked neck really could be cranking up the blood pressure <d-cite key="edwardsetal2007"></d-cite>. 

Indeed proper respiration, that is deep, diaphragmatic breathing, has itself been associated with a host of health benefits<d-cite key="hamasaki2020"></d-cite>. The diaphragm is the primary muscle of respiration. Nonetheless the musculature of the neck, chest, and upper back, such as the scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, and trapezius muscles, also play an auxiliary role in ventilation. Proper engagement of these muscles opens the airways for breathing, and imbalances can lead to constrictions in the breathing passage and shallow breathing patterns. However the direction of the relationship between good posture and good breathing practice is a case of 'chicken or the egg.' On the one hand some studies have found poor posture to impede respiration. One study found forward head posture reduced respiratory capacity and impinged on lower thoracic and diaphragmatic mobility, directly decreasing respiratory function<d-cite key="kosekietal2019"></d-cite>. On the other hand, observance of better breathing habits has been shown to improve posture and mobility. One study measured the impact of breathing exercises on posture and spinal mobility in female university students as compared to yoga and pilates. The study concluded that physiotherapeutic breathing exercises were as effective as yoga and pilates at improving spinal mobility and correcting postural imbalances <d-cite key="csepregietal2022"></d-cite>.

A study out of Japan found a strong association between poor posture and cognitive decline. The study sampled 411 individuals from 50-89 years of age, analyzing inviduals within decade of age (50s, 60s, etc.) and by gender (202 male, 209 female). Participants took two difference cognitive assessments and had their sagittal spinal balance (front to back) measured through radiological methods. The spinal imbalance in the sagittal plane was measured as sagittal vertical axis. The study found sagittal vertical axis anteriorization (SVAA) (i.e. forward leaning) was significantly associated with cognitive decline. For males SVAA > 70 mm over 80, > 90 mm over 70, and > 100 mm at any age were more likely to exhibit cognitive decline. For women at any age, SVAA > 70 mm was associated with increased risks of cognitive decline. For clear radiological images of SVAA, see 'figure 3' in the paper <d-cite key="nishimuraetal2022"></d-cite>.
