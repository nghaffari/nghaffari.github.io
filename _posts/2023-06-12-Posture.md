## Stop Slouching!

"Sit up straight and stop slouching!" Words one might here from a doting grandparent.

## Health Effects of Postural Imbalance

Postural imbalances have been linked to a host of health ailments and even accelerated aging.

One research group at the University of Leeds found a connection between neck posture and changes in cardiorespiration. The team was motivated by previous findings that chiropractic manipulations, particularly of the C1 vertebrae, can induce changes in blood pressure. Their research revealed that the muscles of the neck, especially the suboccipital muscle group send afferent signals to the intermedius of the medulla, a brain stem component. In turn this part of the brainstem sends signals to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The NTS is directly involved in altering cardiorespiratory variables such as blood pressure and breathing rate. In short, the evidence suggests that crooked neck could really be cranking up the blood pressure<d-cite key="edwardsetal2007"></d-cite>.
