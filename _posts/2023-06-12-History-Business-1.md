## The 'History to Business' Series

This post inaugurates a series titled, 'From History to Business.' The aim here is to connect principles and philosophies from ancient warfare to modern business. This genre is already quite popular. Books on ancient warfare strategems, like Sun Tzu's *Art of War* and Miyamoto Musashi's *Book of Five Rings*, have found renewed interest and readership when repackaged as business stratagem guides. As a lifelong, avid student of history, my goal here is to provide links from my own historical readings to modern business strategy principles. For this first part, I will focus on **scouting**, its importance in the ancient world, and its utility in business environments. 

## Seek and You Shall Find

> "...seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." - Matthew 7:7

War is costly and taxing. Warfare drains a nation or organization of its vital resources. War can also be unpredictable. Surprise attacks and ambushes can take down mighty armies. Natural disasters and tumultuous terrain can upend an army's campaign. Internal strife and discord can dismantle an army from within. Precluding all these possibilities absolutely is an impossibility. Precluding these possibilities to the greatest degree possible requires something: *intelligence*. Here we refer to 'scouting' loosely as the process of deliberately seeking and obtaining intelligence. In the ancient world among the ancient armies, scouting was largely a physical process. Today much of scouting and intelligence gathering is nonphysical, but the same principles apply.

Scouting and gathering information fulfills several important intelligence objectives in relation to warfare. These include:

* Knowing the battlefield
* Understanding the enemy
* Reckoning supplies and supply lines

The importance of each has been elucidated in numerous works on the topic of war strategems. For example, on the first point Sun Tzu notes:

> "Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted."

On the second point, Tzu writes:

> "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."

And on the third point, Sun Tzu has also offered numerous opinions. While scouting strategies date back to time immemorial, intelligence scouting and espionage reached a zenith of mastery under the Assyrian empire. The Assyrian people arose in the fertile enclave of Northern Mesopotamia, centered around the city of Ashur and expanding out from there. As an agrarian people on the crossroads of what was then the civilized world, Assyria came under frequent attacks and raids from her neighbors. It was said in ancient Assyria that a man sows his fields with a plow in one hand and a sword in the other. As a result of this environment, Assyria developed into a formidable, warlike empire on several occasions. They attained an advanced level of sophistication with regards to warfare, having a well-regimented army, well-designed supply lines, and a complex espionage network. The Assyrian empire and its military apparatus are studied by modern militaries, including at the US Army War College.
