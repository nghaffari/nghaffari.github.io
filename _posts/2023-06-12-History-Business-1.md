## The 'History to Business' Series

This post inaugurates a series titled, 'From History to Business.' The aim here is to connect principles and philosophies from ancient warfare to modern business. This genre is already quite popular. Books on ancient warfare strategems, like Sun Tzu's *Art of War* and Miyamoto Musashi's *Book of Five Rings*, have found renewed interest and readership when repackaged as business stratagem guides. As a lifelong, avid student of history, my goal here is to provide links from my own historical readings to modern business strategy principles. For this first part, I will focus on scouting, its importance in the ancient world, and its utility in business environments.
