## The 'History to Business' Series

This post inaugurates a series titled, 'From History to Business.' The aim here is to connect principles and philosophies from ancient warfare to modern business. This genre is already quite popular. Books on ancient warfare strategems, like Sun Tzu's *Art of War* and Miyamoto Musashi's *Book of Five Rings*, have found renewed interest and readership when repackaged as business stratagem guides. As a lifelong, avid student of history, my goal here is to provide links from my own historical readings to modern business strategy principles. For this first part, I will focus on **scouting**, its importance in the ancient world, and its utility in business environments. 

## Seek and You Shall Find

> "...seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." - Matthew 7:7

War is costly and taxing. Warfare drains a nation or organization of its vital resources. War can also be unpredictable. Surprise attacks and ambushes can take down mighty armies. Natural disasters and tumultuous terrain can upend an army's campaign. Internal strife and discord can dismantle an army from within. Precluding all these possibilities absolutely is an impossibility. Precluding these possibilities to the greatest degree possible requires something: *intelligence*. Here we refer to 'scouting' loosely as the process of deliberately seeking and obtaining intelligence. In the ancient world among the ancient armies, scouting was largely a physical process. Today much of scouting and intelligence gathering is nonphysical, but the same principles apply.

Scouting and gathering information fulfills several important intelligence objectives in relation to warfare. These include:

* Knowing the battlefield
* Understanding the enemy
* Reckoning supplies and supply lines

The importance of each has been elucidated in numerous works on the topic of war strategems. For example, on the first point Sun Tzu notes:

> "Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted."

On the second point, Tzu writes:

> "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."

And on the third point, Sun Tzu has also offered numerous opinions. While scouting strategies date back to time immemorial, intelligence scouting and espionage reached a zenith of mastery under the Assyrian empire. The Assyrian people arose in the fertile enclave of Northern Mesopotamia, centered around the city of Ashur and expanding out from there. As an agrarian people on the crossroads of what was then the civilized world, Assyria came under frequent attacks and raids from her neighbors. It was said in ancient Assyria that a man sows his fields with a plow in one hand and a sword in the other. As a result of this environment, Assyria developed into a formidable, warlike empire on several occasions. They attained an advanced level of sophistication with regards to warfare, having a well-regimented army, well-designed supply lines, and a complex espionage network. The Assyrian empire and its military apparatus are studied by modern militaries, including at the US Army War College.

The military organization of the Assyrian empire was reached an unparalleled level of development during the neo-Assyrian period (roughly 900-600 BC). During this period the king maintained a network of internal informants who would maintain confidential communications between the king and his provincial governors. This allowed the central government to keep tabs on all corners of the empire and receive advance notice of developing threats. The Assyrians also maintained a network of external spies. This allowed the Assyrians to monitor situations in neighboring civilizations, thwart potential attacks, collect necessary information for their own campaigns, and to engage in sabotage and subterfuge. Additionally, the Assyrian army had units specialized for scouting. This was important for assessing the food and supply situation alongside assessing hostile threats within each theater of operation. The highly developed scouting and intelligence gathering of the Assyrians was critical to their military efficacy.

In the wake of the destruction and reorganization left behind by the Assyrian empire, new nations started to form in the ancient Middle East. In southern Iran, the predominant civilization had been Elam, a major rival of Babylon and Assyria. Elam was eventually devastated by the Assyrian empire, under Ashurbanipal. He openly brags in his chronicles about the brutality and butchery that he wrought upon Elam. He even gloated about sowing salt into their fields to make them infertile and to guarantee that the Elamites would never arise again. While the Assyrians were looking to secure their own position by removing a critical opponent, they overlooked the bigger picture. And while their scouting in the immediate vicinity of their empire was impeccable, they had gaps in their intelligence when it came to regions beyond. And indeed, from regions beyond new entrants were entering the arena. Indo-European speaking Aryan tribes were entering the Iranian Plateau (the word 'Iran' itself means 'land of the Aryans'), gradually replacing the Elamite civilization with their own polities, namely the Mede and Persian kingdoms. The Medes would eventually team up with Babylonians further South to eliminate the Assyrians.

The Median kingdom was replaced by the Persian empire, which fully integrated the Medes (a closely related tribe to Persians). As the Indo-European stock of these Iranian kingdoms came from a background of animal husbandry (particularly cattle) and horseback riding, they were fundamentally a more mobile population, at the time, then more sedentary peoples further West in the Middle East. Hence scouting came naturally to them and was a skill they employed.
