## Changing Job Markets

The information age has fundamentally altered many processes in society. The availability of vast amounts of information coupled with advanced data processing mechanisms has facilitated an increasing emphasis on "data-driven" strategies among organizations. Large firms and institutions are increasingly turning toward data-derived insights to inform and to support decision making. The hiring process is one domain already feeling the effects of these changes.

The hiring process can be a painful, drawn out, cumbersome, and downright expensive process. And that holds for both job seekers and job recruiters. For job hunters, the search for a decent position is time-consuming, often involving dozens, if not hundreds, of applications each filled with cycles of interviews, document drafting, aptitude and skills assessments, and negotiations. Even competent and accomplished candidates can find themselves drifting for months in search of fitting role. For the job seekers, there is also an unfair asymmetry at play; their position during the hiring process is usually a big unknown. Recruitees are often left guessing how likely they are to land a position, how stiff the competition is, what work culture characteristics the recruiting firm is looking for, and so on. It is a typical practice for mid to large size firms to take multiple candidates through the entire interview process, knowing full well that most candidates will not be offered any position. These candidates are only being entertained as alternates and to fill hiring process quotas. The whole process can be an immense drain on a job seeker's time, and as the old adage goes, "time is money."

The recruitment process can also be stressful and costly on the hiring side. Finding the right candidate for an open position typically involves casting a wide net, sifting through voluminous quantities of resumes, cover letters, and applications. Giving due attention to the right candidates is time-consuming and difficult for firms without large resources to devote to the recruitment process. Hiring for a new type of role presents an added difficulty; if a firm does not have much experience in a technical area, it can be hard to assess the quality and fit of candidates for such a new type of role. And even when firms hone in on a stellar candidate, it is not unusal for top talent to be sitting on multiple job offers. If they decide their services will be more valued elsewhere, that leaves the firm having to restart their hiring process for the position all over again.

## AI Hiring

There is a notion that ‘data science and analytics’ is a neutral, unbiased mechanism for analyzing data and making data-driven decisions. There is a bit of truth here. AI and machine learning, deployed effectively, can help reduce bias. By combing through vast volumes of data, more than a human could process in a feasible amount of time, data analytics and algorithms can facilitate data-driven decision making. By deploying rigorous analytic techniques, rooted in mathematics and statistics, AI and machine learning also remove some of the inherent biases of relying solely on human opinion and intuition. Nonetheless there is still arbitrariness in the choice of algorithm and in the choice of data processing and modeling methodologies. To assume that data analytics can completely remove all biases is a mistake. As Gideon Mann and Cathy O’Neil observe writing for the **Harvard Business Review** <d-cite key="gideononeil2016"></d-cite>,

“Algorithms are, in part, our opinions embedded in code. They reflect human biases and prejudices that lead to machine learning mistakes and misinterpretations. This bias shows up in numerous aspects of our lives, including algorithms used for electronic discovery, teacher evaluations, car insurance, credit score rankings, and university admissions.”
