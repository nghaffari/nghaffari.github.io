## Two Tales

Man's relationship with technology has been a two-way street. The development of tools and the systematization of knowledge and operations has driven development from the ancient world to modern times. The realized potential unlocked by ever-progressing technology has brought a slew of benefits and detriments to human society and to the human condition; it is a case of two tales. Ultimately technological development brings powerful advancements in capabilities. Whether these capabilities serve a benefit or bring a loss depends on man's awareness and man's choices in use. As the progression of technological development continues to pick up pace, particularly with the emerging phenomenon of general AI systems, man stands at a crossroads. Will he choose a path that integrates tech in meaningful, impactful ways or will he use technology in a manner harming health, environment, and productivity? Ultimately our choices surrounding the development, adoption, and implementation of emerging tech will shape our future tale of technology.
