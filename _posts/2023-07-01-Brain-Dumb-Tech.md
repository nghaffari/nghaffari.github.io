## Two Tales

Man's relationship with technology has been a two-way street. The development of tools and the systematization of knowledge and operations has driven development from the ancient world to modern times. The realized potential unlocked by ever-progressing technology has brought a slew of benefits and detriments to human society and to the human condition; it is a case of two tales. Ultimately tech brings powerful advancements in capabilities. Whether these capabilities serve a benefit or bring a loss depends on man's awareness of and man's choices in using technology. As the progression of technological development continues to pick up pace, particularly with the emerging phenomenon of general AI systems, man stands at a crossroads. Will he choose a path that integrates tech in meaningful, impactful ways or will he use technology in a manner harming health, environment, and productivity? Ultimately our choices surrounding the development, adoption, and implementation of emerging tech will shape our future tale of technology.

The development of writing is an early example. Modern historians believe writing may have been invented independently by several civilizations (Sumerian, Egyptian, Mesoamerican, and Chinese) starting 5-6000 years ago, though it may in fact predate this. Regardless, writing has been an absolutely fundamental pillar underpinning the legacy of humanity's tech development. Written systems of communication have played critical roles in the development of math, science, literature, computer coding, and mass communication. Even my musings in this piece could only be shared with you via writing! The central role of written communication in the development of civilization is undeniable. And it has been a continuous process of development. Even after the advent of writing systems, competency in writing was still a rarity. A proper education and training in writing was uncommon, and in many ancient societies the vast majority were still illiterate. It took an array of other advancements (e.g., the production of paper, the printing press, the digital representation of different languages via computers, etc.) and modern education to change this. Today written communication is commonplace and still exploding in growth. One 2018 survey found that in an average minute, 187 million emails, 18 million text messages, 38 million Whatsapp messages, and 3.7 million Google queries were made <d-cite key="clayton2019"></d-cite>.

Writing spurned the recording of history, of astronomy, and of literature. Writing enabled enhanced communication within and between different societies and facilitated greater trade between peoples. But excessive reliance on the written word also brought drawbacks. With written communication, forgery, slander, and propaganda found a new tool for dissemination. The reliance of lists of items and ideas reduced the need for committing these things to memory. The implementation of writing also brought effects on the physical health and vitality of individuals engaged in long bouts of writing. These changes between more sedentary, literate populations and more 'primitive,' typically nomadic populations was readily recognized in the ancient world. The Bedouin Arabs saw these distinctions between themselves and the city-dwellers of Makka and Medina. The nomadic, warlike Mongols of Genghis Khan saw the same in the themselves with respect to the more sedentary, literature peoples of China and Central Asia. The Jewish-Muslim Iraqi mystic Abu al-Baraka al-Baghdadi observed the same and even remarked on how humanity was being transformed by urbanization into sedentary, literate societies. He understood that despite the advancements brought by writing and urban civilization in general, man was losing somewhat of his intuition and fluid intelligence from surviving in a primitive state in nature. As with all things there is a tradeoff.

Standing at the crossroads of this tradeoff, it is up to us to make the best choices surrounding the use and adoption of technology moving forward. A big part of this process is in understanding the detriments that current technologies bring and devising ways to mitigate these detriments or to convert them into benefits. There are many negative effects to examine here. For instance, many modern technologies also bring injurious impacts to the environment. In this article the focus will be on *cognitive* impacts. The piece will explore some of the emerging trends of technological impacts on human cognition. Indeed, as society becomes increasingly sophisticated and technologically advanced, intelligence and critical thinking is imperative to manage this process. Hence, it is important to understand potential adverse effects on human intelligence, as well as ways of alleviating this. This article will continue with an overview of the Flynn and reverse Flynn effects, transitioning into a discussion of the negative effects of emerging tech on cognition and strategies for fixing this.
